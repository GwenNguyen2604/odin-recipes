        <ol>
            <li> Bring 1/2-inch water in a saucepan to a boil. Carefully place 
                 cold eggs into saucepan, cover with a lid, reduce heat to 
                 medium-high, and cook for about 6 minutes. Remove from heat 
                 and pour cold water over eggs to halt the cooking process. 
                 Cool eggs to room temperature in cold water. Peel and dry eggs
                 on paper towels. </li>
            <li> Mix sausage, mustard, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and green onion 
                 together in a bowl. Shape into 6 equal-size balls.  </li>
            <li> Lay a piece of plastic wrap on a flat work surface. Place 1 
                 sausage ball onto the center of the wrap, fold the wrap over 
                 sausage, and flatten into an 1/8-inch-thick oval shape. Pull 
                 plastic wrap back and place 1 egg in the center of the sausage.
                 Fold and press sausage around egg to cover completely using 
                 moistened fingertips.  </li>
            <li> Repeat with remaining eggs and sausage.  </li>
            <li> Place breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl. Pour flour into another 
                 shallow bowl.  </li>
            <li> Gently press eggs into flour to coat; shake off excess flour.
                 Dip eggs into the beaten egg, then press into breadcrumbs. 
                 Place the breaded eggs onto a plate.  </li>
            <li> Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F 
                 (175 degrees C). Working in batches, cook eggs in the preheated
                 oil until golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to 
                 cool, at least 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> In a small bowl, compare the aioli ingredients together. Enjoy 
                 the eggs with aioli.  </li>
