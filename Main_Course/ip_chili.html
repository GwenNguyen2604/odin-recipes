        <ol>
            <li> Turn a 6-quart Instant Pot to the normal sauté setting and add
                 the oil. When hot, add the ground chuck, chili powder and 1 
                 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring and breaking up the meat but 
                 still leaving some larger chunks, until browned, about 5 
                 minutes. Stir in the garlic and onion and cook, stirring, 1 
                 minute more. Add the tomatoes, beans, Worcestershire and 
                 coffee or cocoa and stir to combine. Follow the manufacturer's 
                 guide for locking the lid and preparing to cook. Set to pressure 
                 cook on high for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> After the pressure-cook cycle is complete, follow the 
                 manufacturer's guide for quick release and wait until the 
                 quick-release cycle is complete. Being careful of any remaining 
                 steam, unlock and remove the lid. </li>
            <li> Season with salt if needed and serve over rice with grated 
                 cheese, sour cream, and pickled jalapeños. </li>
        </ol>
