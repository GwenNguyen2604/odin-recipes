        <!-- direction in order -->
        <p><i> Directions </i></p>
        <ol>
            <li> Cook lasagna noodle according to package instruction. </li>
            <li> In a medium sized pot heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium 
                 high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly 
                 browned on all sides. Remove the beef to a bowl. Drain off all
                 but a tablespoon of fat. </li>
            <li> Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the pot, cook for 4 
                 to 5 minutes, until softened. Add the minced garlic and cook 
                 half a minute more. Return the browned ground beef to the pot.
                 Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another
                 5 minutes. </li>
            <li> Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the
                 pot. Then add the rest of the spices, adjusting the amounts to
                 taste. </li>
            <li> Add red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at
                 a time, tasting after each addition. Add salt, note that you
                 will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty. </li>
            <li> Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain 
                 a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Remove 
                 from heat once done. </li>
            <li> Once the noodle is done, drain in a colander and rinse with cool
                 water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking 
                 together. Spread a little olive oil on a large baking sheet,
                 and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over 
                 so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil. This 
                 will prevent them from sticking together. </li>
            <li> In a 9x13-inch casserole dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread 
                 it over the bottom of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna 
                 noodles over the sauce. Ladle 1/3 of the remaining sauce over 
                 the noodles. Sprinkle 1/3 of the grated mozzarella on top of 
                 lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese in dollops. 
                 Sprinkle half the parmesan cheese evenly over the top of 
                 ricotta cheese. </li>
            <li> Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half of the remaining
                 sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining
                 ricotta cheese, and another the remaining Parmesan. </li>
            <li> Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce 
                 over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining 
                 Mozzarella cheese. </li>
            <li> Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil. Bake at 375°F for 45 
                 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 for a crusty top or edges. Let
                 cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. </li>
        </ol>
