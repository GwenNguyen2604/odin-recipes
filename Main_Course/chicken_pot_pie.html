        <ol>
            <li> Make dough: First, place flour and butter into freezer for 30
                 minutes. In a large food processor, pulse flour, baking powder,
                 and salt until combined. Add butter and pulse until pea-sized 
                 and some slightly larger pieces form. With the machine running,
                 add ice water, 1 tbs. at a time, until dough just come together 
                 and is moist but not wet and sticky. Turn dough onto a lightly 
                 floured surface, form into 2 balls, and flatten into 2 discs 
                 (making sure there are no/minimal cracks). Cover with plastic 
                 wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. </li>
            <li> Cook chicken: Preheat oven to 400°. Grease a large baking dish 
                 with butter and grease one side of a large piece of parchment
                 with butter. Season chicken with salt and pepper then place in 
                 baking dish. Place buttered side of parchment paper over chicken.
                 Bake until chicken is cooked through, 30 to 40 minutes. Let rest 
                 10 minutes before cutting into cubes. </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, start filling: In a large pot over medium heat, 
                 melt butter. Add onions and carrots and cook until vegetables 
                 are beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Stir in garlic and 
                 flour, cook until the flour mixture is golden and beginning 
                 to bubble. Gradually whisk in chicken broth. Bring mixture to 
                 a boil and cook until thickened. Stir in heavy cream, cubed 
                 chicken, peas, parsley, and thyme. Season mixture with salt and 
                 pepper. </li>
            <li> Assemble pie: On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disc
                 of dough into a large round about ¼” thick. Place in a shallow 
                 pie dish then add filling. Roll out second disc of dough into a 
                 large round about ¼” thick and place on top of filling. Trim 
                 and crimp edges, then use a paring knife to create slits on top.
                 Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. </li>
            <li> Reduce heat to 375° and bake pie until crust is golden, about 
                 45 minutes. Let cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. </li>
