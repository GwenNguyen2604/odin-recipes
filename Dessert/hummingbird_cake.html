            <li> 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg </li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger </li>
            <li> 1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda </li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li> 3 large eggs, at room temperature </li>
            <li> 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar </li>

        </ul>

        <!-- direction in order -->

        <ol>
            <li> Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 
                 8-inch round cake pans and line with parchment paper. Butter 
                 the parchment and dust with flour. </li>
            <li> Spread the pecans on a baking sheet and bake until fragrant 
                 and toasted, about 8 minutes. Let cool slightly, then roughly 
                 chop. Toss with the bananas, pineapple and 1/2 cup flour in a 
                 small bowl. </li>
            <li> Whisk the remaining 2 1/4 cups flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg, 
                 ginger, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Beat the eggs and 
                 granulated sugar in a separate bowl with a mixer on high speed 
                 until thick and light, 5 minutes. Gradually beat in the 
                 vegetable oil. </li>
            <li> Sprinkle the flour mixture over the egg mixture, then gently 
                 fold to make a thick batter. Fold in the pecan-fruit mixture, 
                 then transfer the batter to the prepared pans. Bake until the 
                 cakes are firm and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes 
                 out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pans on a rack, 25 
                 minutes, then invert the cakes onto the rack to cool completely. </li>
            <li> Make the frosting: Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with 
                 a mixer until fluffy, then gradually beat in the butter until 
                 combined. Sift the confectioners' sugar over the cream cheese 
                 mixture and beat until smooth. Add the lemon zest and vanilla 
                 and beat until light and fluffy. </li>
            <li> Place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread about half of 
                 the frosting on top, then cover with the other cake layer. 
                 Spread the remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake. </li>
            <li> Optional: decorate with more pecans and pineapple flowers </li>
        </ol>
